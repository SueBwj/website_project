It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. \n\nIsrael (I\u2019ll say \u2018allegedly\u2019 for legal reasons, as Israel hasn\u2019t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c\u2019mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I\u2019ve seen. \n\nThese pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. \n\nThe effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah\u2019s communications system, assert Israel\u2019s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. \n\nThe attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. \n\nI know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. \n\nI still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy. \n\nWhat will CMV: proof that the pager attack targeted civilians, suggestions of alternative, more targeted and proportionate methods for Israel to attack its enemies. \n\nWhat will not CMV: anecdotal, unconfirmed tales of mass death as a result of the pager attacks, arguments that focus on Israel\u2019s existence, arguments about Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, or discussions of Israel\u2019s criminal government.

Just because something works in case A doesn't mean it works in case B - it **could**, of course, but that is a very different discussion that we can't really hold because we don't know anything about the logistics on either side.\n\nPlus, finally, it's still a large risk. If the Hezbollah had decided that they'd rather not use these pagers for whatever reason, handed them off, etc., this attack would have caused significantly more civilian casualties (although I frankly don't know the number). So, on top of it being a very different situation, it's also a very delicate situation where small missteps can have significant impacts.",

Israel set up a fake Hungarian company to produce the pagers and the first shipments happened in the summer of 2022. The answer to why Israel didn't do the same to Hamas is that at that time Hamas was not viewed as a threat. The intelligence assessment was that Hamas was trying to maintain the status quo and that their military capability was limited. This is part of why Bibi was making sure that they were able to receive funds from Qatar. Meanwhile Hezbollah is much bigger, more organized, and has weapons that can strike throughout Israel. Israeli intelligence was also busy with Iran. The Israeli military is very good for its size, but being able to handle many high complexity operations at once is something only superpowers can do.",

This is apparently a thing you have to deal with though. Apparently somebody is going around setting up fake companies to facilitate terrorism.\n\nI have to wonder what would have turned up if someone investigated this. Sure it says they used a bunch of shell companies, but if you traced it to its source what would you find? Even if somebody traced it to its source when you find that kind of source are you supposed to be suspicious of it if you want to try to prevent this? What would \"suspicious behaviour\" have even constituted in this case and would have preventing it not have just resulted in more headache than it was worth because of how indistinguishable it would have been from what might be considered unjustified persecution for which all sorts of organizations exist to supposedly prevent? Just seems to be a violation of trust that somebody would even think about doing this. Are we supposed to just be supiscious of anything which has multiple shell companies which can eventually be traced back to Israel, doesn't that basically give everyone a reason to participate in a boycott, sanction, and divestment if only to stop them from trying to exploit this trust they have as a result of the general good will everyone has towards each other which allows globalized corporate law to even function where you can set up companies where you need them to be and you can have companies owning other companies where appropriate? You can only have a globalized economy if you can be fairly certain that one country isn't going to try to use that to mail bombs to people.",

If they can't aim very well I highly doubt they are targetting civilians. There are many military targets in Israel their bottle rockets could hit. The IDF has a greater capacity for accuracy and yet they are killing a considerable portion of the civilian population of Gaza, you hardly have room to complain when a less accurate rocket can't be successfully aimed at one of Israel's military bases. Do you think they would deliberately choose to not hit a military base if they could aim? No they'd love it if they hit a strategically important target, they just don't have the capability yet.",

Do you really want to be the country responsible for why we had to add one to the list?\n\nRegardless even if it isn't a warcrime I still made a compelling argument for why one would need to boycott, sanction, and divest Israel in order to avoid being forced to be involved in this nonsense, whatever you call it. Even if you investigated the shell companies and eventually found Israel involvement, how are you supposed to know that this is suspicious? Particularly if Israel won't let you investigate further once you trace things back to Israel in order to distinguish between a Mossad operation and just a regular Israeli business venture. Like I said: what would you have found if you had been suspicious and tried to investigate? Probably not Mossad Ltd. You probably wouldn't be able to distinguish it from any other Israeli registered corporation. It would be even worse if Israel got operatives to start the shell company game from another country because that would mean you would need to be suspicious of Israeli citizens starting companies rather than just companies whose shells can be traced back to Israel.\n\nEven if this isn't a \"war crime\" what are you supposed to do if you don't want to be involved it whatever \"this\" is? What if you just don't want to potentially kill the people who import from your country because you think that is bad business because it might reduce your customer base?",

If the Hezbollah had decided that they'd rather not use these pagers for whatever reason, handed them off, etc., this attack would have caused significantly more civilian casualties (although I frankly don't know the number). So, on top of it being a very different situation, it's also a very delicate situation where small missteps can have significant impacts.\n\nI think it's safe to say an operation like this wouldn't have killed tens of thousands of women and children, an unknown number of civilian men, and decimated the homes of over a million families. Even if the pagers had been distributed to one child each and they exploded in their class at school, the death toll in children alone would have been a couple orders of magnitude lower. \n\nYou're right, we have no way of knowing if Hamas officials have a security gap like these pagers. However we do know that mass bombing of civilians and dismantling the entire infrastructure of Gaza was evil, a violation of international law, and was never about dismantling Hamas.",

If the Hezbollah had decided that they'd rather not use these pagers for whatever reason, handed them off\" - Hezbollah went to using the lower tech pagers to avoid targeting by Israel which was intercepting cell phone signals. Despite Arab countries being generally poor, cell phones and smart phones are ubiquitous among the Arab populations. There is no reason for anyone not associated with Hezbollah to have had those pagers. That doesn't mean someone standing next to an exploding pager wouldn't get hurt, but this was about as perfect a surgical strike as can be imagined. There is no good reason to keep searching for made-up risks, as even Hezbollah admitted to having been hit hard. \n\nYou are, however, correct that Hamas was perceived as a more traditional terror threat, rather than as an army and a possible instigator of war. This was short sighted, as Israel knew they were building an extensive tunnel network, which is a defensive tactic, something that would be useless without a full scale war. This network proved to be formidable as all tunnel networks proved to be going back at least 100 years. I am sure at some point Israel will have a full review of what went wrong with Gaza before Oct 7th, and someone will have to take responsibility for the Oct 7th disaster, but another important difference that should never be ignored: Hezbollah has a base and an interest in Lebanon, they are not Palestinians, and even though they are nominally aiding Gaza, they have not fully committed themselves. Hamas, the leadership of Gaza, have promised that Oct 7th wasn't just a show of force; they said they will want to do 100s and 1000s of Oct 7th repeats until there is no Israel. That is the kind of statement that made it impossible for Israel to not wage an all out war to eliminate Hamas as an organized and capable force.",

The virtue signaling anti-Israel people are saying that Israel is not targeting Hamas but just killing lots of Palestinians, including Hamas.

They didn't detonate right after they were purchased, and there's a pretty good chance that not all of the pagers were sent a detonation command; only the ones which Israel knew were currently being used by Hezbollah.\n\nMeaning, there's probably undetonated pagers out there which were sold second-hand to civilians.",

Upwards of 80% of Christian nationalists support Israel, some are neutral, and very few are the Nazi kind of Christian nationalist anymore. They use similar tactics to craft a warped view of history, demonization and othering, and even the use of the same dog-whistles.This is mainstream Christian Nationalism, the current opposition party, not some fringe minority. The leadership of Christian nationalists are by and large white nationalists as well. That's why skin color can be brought up. \n\nI just got done arguing with one of these people today. He decided to be cute and look through my profile to see if I wrote anything anti-Semitic. He couldn't because I'm not. Are there anti-Semitic people who hate Israel? Absolutely, no denying that. But my position is based on two things. Indefinite occupation and codifying the ethno-state. \n\nSo then I decided to go through his shit and I put the pieces together that he uses Christian nationalist white supremacist rhetoric. I found some really disgusting deleted comments and some disgusting ones that were still there. Like where he said \"Israelis know they're superior to Palestinians.\" \n\nMaybe that's why skin color was at the forefront of my mind when I replied to you. I'm not accusing you of being one or every supporter of Israel of being one.

Whiteness is the foundation for White Supremacist theory. The idea that White is superior and White is conditional. So in that sense, as an answer you question, none are white. \n\nUnfortunately we still have to navigate this society as if this race classification system has merit, and I have to play along because if I didn't I would have to explain this fringe opinion often, that we should abandon race classification entirely and at most use ethnic classification. It also makes talking about systemic issues caused by white supremacy without using the framework of white supremacy very difficult. So in this sense, I don't think most Israelis are white even though some are. \n\nBut I'm convinced that typically Christian Nationalists support Israel for its ethno-state and spiritual war between their \"Judeo-Christian\" team and their rivals, the Islamists. Therefore, Israel is on the white team, not the wrong team. Because that's how white supremacists think. And it wasn't that long ago that white supremacists typically didn't think any Jews were white, because white is only conditional based on its usefulness to the supremacists in power.",

The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people. \n\nHere is the rhetoric from the people who passed this legislation\n\n>Chairman Ohana stated: \"This is the law of all laws. It is the most important law in the history of the State of Israel, which says that everyone has human rights, but national rights in Israel belong only to the Jewish people. That is the founding principle on which the state was established\". \n\n>Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended his draft of the Nation-State bill on 26 November 2014, declaring Israel to be \"The nation-state of the Jewish people, and the Jewish people alone\".\n\nI don't really care what the Oxford dictionary says, making a law, the most important law of all laws, that declares a nation only truly belongs to one ethnicity, is an ethno-state. \n\n>Do you mean you are against Israel being a country where jews have self-determination?\n\nI'm against Israel being a country where Jewish people are legally the only ethnicity the nation truly belongs to. \n\nIn 2024 Jewish people have the right of self-determination just about everywhere in the West and elsewhere. That's not to say anti-Semitism isn't still a problem, to be clear. \n\n>Even though it's because of the abuse jews endured all over the world?\n\nSo it's their turn to be supremacist?

Ethno-states by definition divide people by ethnicity. \n\nYou argued that as long as an ethnic minority wants their own ethno-state, they should have it. How do you propose every ethnic minority that wants an ethno-state to draw new borders and make one without conflict?\n\n>If a certain ethnicity or group feels they need self determination and all move to the same area and demand self determination then they should get self determination.\n\nExcept for the Palestinians though right? It's indefinite occupation and blockades for them right? Because reasons. \n\nAnd you already rejected that self-determination could be held as an ethnic minority without an ethno-state. So you can't claim they have it currently. See below for what you said. \n\n>Jews are a small minority in every other country other than Israel, meaning that they are subjected to the decisions of others on how they are allowed to live their lives. There is no self-determination for the jews anywhere in the world other than Israel.\n\nThe Palestinians are a small minority in every other country, even in Israel they're a minority, meaning that they are subjected to the decisions of others on how they're allowed to live their lives. There is no self-determination for the Palestinians anywhere in the world, even in Israel. \n\nTherefore according to this logic, they should get at least a part of Israel now, indefinitely occupy the remaining Israelis, and declare an ethno-state until the cycle repeats again as it logically must. \n\nHowever, you don't actually believe this. And it's very difficult not to assume that maybe the reason for that is you've been convinced by a narrative that supports systems of ethnic supremacy. That some ethnicities are somehow more equal and deserving than others. \n\n>If the Mizrahi, Ashkenazi, and Sephardic Jewish each demand self determination and each move to a different part of the country then they should get self determination and the country should be split. For now they don't want that and want to be unified and mixed so they should be unified.\n\nThe point of this wasn't to make a claim that they wanted to. It's a hypothetical with the presupposition that they want to, in order to show the logical conclusion is an infinite division of self-determination led micro-ethno-states. Which almost always leads to conflict. Not guaranteed every time, but history shows when ethno-nationalists seek out an ethno-state, war tends to be how that's achieved. \n\n>It doesn't even have to be about ethnicity, different nations form on other bases than ethnicity.\n\nAnd I'm fine with nations forming over shared culture, shared language, shared goals and shared ideology. Not genetics. \n\nBut since I'm not a racial or ethnic supremacist, I don't believe any nation should be a racial or ethnic supremacy. \n\nShould the Tejanos, who are indigenous to Texas, be able to do the same? I bet if you offered the Tejanos Texas back, they would take it. \n\nMexican isn't an ethnicity, it's a nationality, and Tejanos are a minority ethnicity without an ethno-state, therefore by your own definition, they don't have self-determination. And by your logic should be given Texas or a war should be waged to take Texas in their name if the current Texas residents oppose it. \n\n>So no, not every ethnic minority should get their own state, since most minorities don't want their own states or are not actively seeking their own state and moving and forming a seperate community.\n\nBut you believe that every ethnic minority, who wants their own ethno-state, deserves one. \n\nThere are about 500 distinct native American ethnicities in the United States. Many of whom are part of the Land-Back movement. So this fits your criteria of being an ethnic minority and wanting ethnic based self-determination. \n\n(To be clear the United States does owe native tribes reparations) \n\nWhich state or states should the United States government relinquish so they can have their own ethno-states? They are currently subject to federal law and therefore, according to you, have no self-determination. And since we are going by indigenous location, it may well be that the majority of States that would need to have land relinquished and borders redrawn. \n\nIf the United States government refuses to give up the land, would you support a foreign government waging war to provide these ethnic minorities with their own ethno-states?\n\nThis is why believing in the merit of ethno-states is dangerous. \n\nWhat I find is people who argue for the ethno-state of Israel tend to not support other ethno-states in the same way. Therefore it's not a principled position, it's an ethnic supremacist position. That one, or more, ethnicities are more equal and more deserving than others.\n\nThis is why even some anti-semitic white nationalists support Israel. Not because they care about the Jewish people, but because they want the world to accept the position that ethno-states are moral. \n\nI'm not comparing you to these people. You clearly care about the Jewish people and your intentions seem good. I just don't think the outcomes of your position when applied principally are a net good for human progress. And I definitely don't think when they're a net good when applied from a supremacist perspective.",

If the jews want self-determination in Israel because of all the abuse they endured they should have it.\n\nThe problem with your examples here is that UK and Northern Irish aren't ethnicities. They're nationalities. \n\nTo be consistent you must necessarily believe the Celts should be able to return to Britain from all over the world, they should be internationally supported in their efforts to ethnically cleanse anyone who is not Celtic, and if they let some people stay, legally this new ethno-state is stated to never really be their nation, only a Nation for Celts. \n\nAnd I'm sure I'll address this again later. But there may be a reason why you couldn't draw a comparison between Jewish people and another ethnicity, and instead drew a comparison between nationalities and ethnicity. Which is not the same thing.  \n\n>>Except for the Palestinians though right?\n\n>I said everyone, that includes the palestinians, but the palestinians are currently seeking self determination on top of all the land of Israel, they don't seek seperation, they seek to conquest 100% of Israeli land. \"from the river to the sea\". That I am against. if they seek self determination in the areas they live in (aka the west bank, gaza, east jerusalem) I will support it.\n\nIsrael currently controls or occupies the land from river to sea. Israel is still annexing more land in the West Bank. \n\n>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his rejection to the establishment of a Palestinian state on Thursday, stating that Israel will take control over \u201cfrom the river to the sea,\u201d according to the English translation of a televised statement he has made at a nationally broadcast news conference.\n>\n>In the translated segment, provided by Israeli news channel i24NEWS, Netanyahu said, \u201cIn any other arrangement in the future, the state of Israel will be in control of all area from the river to the sea.\u201d\n\nThis is the ethno-state you support. \n\nAnd I saw at the end you asked how your view supremacist?  It's right here. \n\nYou support the Israeli ethno-state doing the very thing you oppose Hamas wanting. \n\nAnd if you go back to before the European migration to the Levant, you justify the Israeli right to \"seek self determination on top of all the land of Mandated Palestine\" and \"to conquest 100% of the land of Mandated Palestine.\". \n\nBut you don't apply the same standards to the Palestinians. This is why your position is inconsistent and supremacist. \n\n>>It's indefinite occupation and blockades for them right? Because reasons.\n\n>Yes, because they seek destruction of Israel, no blockades and occupation mean massive attacks on Israel, I know that is probably what you seek, \n\nThe same can be said for Israel. They seek to destroy what's left of Palestine. Explicitly. And this isn't new. You should look into the shit Ben Gurion and the World Zionist Organization (that's the official name, I'm not using Zionist as a slur) said about their intentions. This has been the plan. \n\nTheres only two things I want destroyed in regards to Israel. The first, is the idea that a nation can declare any ethnicity as having more claim to the nation over another. The second is the indefinte occupation of Palestinians. \n\nNow to some, Israel isn't Israel unless they're an ethno-state. And to them it sounds like I want the destruction of Israel. \n\nBut I hope you can see the difference between the two. \n\n>but I don't know why you are suprised when Israelis don't want to be attacked/murdered.\n\nAnd I don't know why you're surprised that when you colonize and indefinitly occupy people and only allow them to live in barely subsistent conditions that they won't turn violent. Especially when you signal that not only could they never be a part of your society, that they will never have self-determination within in their homeland again, and that you also seek to completely remove them from every last square inch through force. \n\nThis is the supremacy I'm talking about. You only  support one groups right to conquer, displace, disenfranchise, rape, pillage, and murder and you'll call it self-defense. \n\n>I believe the palestinians should get self-determination once they start seeking it in a way that doesn't include destroying Israel and the right to self determination of the jews.\n\nBut you support Israel destroying Palestine and destroying the Palestinians right to self determination. \n\nSupremacist logic. \n\n>Nope, you just believe palestinians should be free to attack Israel as much as they like until Israel is destroyed, I don't believe in this type of freedom.\n\nFirst off, I've demonstrated clearly your position is inconsistent based on ethnic lines, and therefore it's supremacist. \n\nSecondly, I don't believe Palestinians should be free to attack Israel to the point of removing Israeli, or Jewish, rights of self-determination. Because I'm consistent. I am just as opposed to a Palestinian ethno-state. \n\nThirdly, which is an extension of my previous point, You don't believe in the type of freedom for Palestinians to \"destroy Israel\" but you believe in the type of freedom for Israel to \"destroy Palestine\". \n\nThe issue here is that you can't conceive of someone having a consistent position not rooted in supremacy. \n\n>I think I answered that in that case, if things go to such extremes they feel they can't live with each other, and they move to seperate areas and demand self determination there, they should get it imo. I don't know whats so hard to understand.\n\nThe part where this justifies ethnic cleansing in order to sustain an ethno-state. \n\n>The thing is that the genetics determine the shared goals in this case, the goal of getting away from all the racist attacks on jews worldwide and having the ability to persecute anyone who does those attacks.\n\nJewish people have had more safety and security in the United States than anywhere else, prior to the European migration to the Levant, and after the formation of Israel. There were also offers from other countries to gift them land, and the early Zionists (their own term for themselves, not a slur) decided that safety and security wasn't the highest priority. The highest priority was taking the land that lies between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. \n\nYou can read about the founders of Israel and verify that they turned down those offers and knew that creating Israel where it is now will need to be done through violence.",

But this sums everything up. \n\n**Everything you've accused Palestinians of doing, that you've used as justification for ethnic cleansing, indefinite occupation, and the denial of self-determination of the Palestinians, Israel has also done** \n\nI'm not simply comparing actions, I'm pointing out your hypocrisy in your justifications.\n\nThe examples you listed aren't comparable, because you're not using the same justifications for one but not the other. That's the problem you can't grasp. But I'll make it really easy for you and I'll go back point by point  and prove the hypocrisy in the justifications you've given that you believe give Israel the right to destroy Palestine, but those same exact justifications don't work the opposite way. \n\n>Jews have no self determination anywhere outside Israel\n\nPalestinians have no self determination anywhere \n\n>Jews are a small minority in every other country other than Israel\n\nPalestinians are a small minority in every other country other than Israel \n\n>If any group decides they want self-determination they should get it if there is a way to give it to them. \n\nYou support the Israeli government that says Palestinians should never have it. \n\n>If a certain ethnicity or group feels they need self determination and all move to the same area and demand self determination then they should get self determination. \n\nExcept for Palestinians. You support the Jewish migrants to moving to Mandated Palestine, ethnically cleansing 300,000 Palestinians (prior to the 1948 war btw, it was another 450,000 after), demanding self-determination and then getting it. But when the Palestinians want to all move (back) to the same area and demand self determination, you think Israel should kill them for trying to do so and indefinitely occupy them to prevent that. \n\n>I said everyone, that includes the palestinians, but the palestinians are currently seeking self determination on top of all the land of Israel, they don't seek seperation, they seek to conquest 100% of Israeli land. \"from the river to the sea\". That I am against.\n\nYou claim to believe the Palestinians deserve self-determination on the condition that it's not \"on top of all the land of Israel, they don't seek seperation, they seek to conquest 100% of Israeli land. \"from the river to the sea\". That I am against.\"\n\nEverything you're accusing the Palestinians of wanting to do, the Israeli government is actually doing right now. \n\nYou claim that you are against \n\n1) taking over the entire piece of land \n\n2) not wanting to seek separation\n\n3) seek to conquest 100% of the land from river to sea\n\nI was able to demonstrate this is true by showing you the Israeli government's own words claiming these policy positions. \n\nSo pay attention really closely.\n\nYou're not actually against those things. You're only against the Palestinians doing it. You support Israel doing it. And this is the supremacist position. \n\n>You would choose the tanks invading Israel and advanced rockets on Israel in attempts to destroy the country.\n\nI would choose Israel taking responsibility for the material conditions they created and taking restorative actions to pay reparations to Palestinians for the land they've taken and the systemic oppression they've inflicted and do everything they can to over time convince peaceful Palestinians to join a multi-ethnic nation with full and equal protections. \n\nI'm being extremely clear about what I want. You've accused me of wanting Palestinians to do to Israel what Israel is currently doing to Palestine. Multiple times. This is not at all what I believe. You keep doing this because you cannot fathom what a principled position actually looks like. \n\nHowever, when I say you support an ethno-state that seeks to ethnically cleanse, indefinitely occupy, and deny any solution to the Palestinians other than to suffer and die, it's accurate. I don't have to lie about what you support. \n\n>You are just incredibly stupid or you are malicious if you think its supremacist logic to deny self determination of palestinians when what they determine to do is to destroy another nation.\n\nYou're just incredibly stupid or malicious if you think it's not supremacist logic to support Israel actually destroying another nation, but you're against Palestinians thinking about destroying another nation. \n\nYou don't actually care whether or not a nation is destroyed by ethno-nationalists. Your issue is that it's not the correct ethno-nationalists doing it. \n\n>You have only demonstrated you are either 1. incredibly stupid 2. arguing in bad faith or 3. believe palestinians have the right to murder Israelis and no-one has a right to stop them and you refuse to even try to understand any other position.\n\n>which is it?\n\nYou failed to address anything I demonstrated whatsoever, you've completely misrepresented my position multiple times, and you moved onto insults because the cognitive dissonance is now too hard to handle.\n \nYour entire position can be summed up as Israel good and Palestine bad. \n\nOh, the IDF routinely forcibly removes Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank so Karen from Brooklyn can move in, well that's fine, not just fine but morally correct. The Palestinians are **thinking** about removing Israelis from their homes so they can take back the homes stolen from them, yea that's bad, better commit human rights abuses against them so they don't do it. \n\nAnd I didn't even get into all the evidence that Hamas is manufactured consent by Likud so Netanyahu can retain power and complete the genocide. There are former advisors, former ambassadors, former generals, former MKs, that have whistleblown on the Likud coalition's plans to purposely fund radical islamist mosques in the 80s, that supported Hamas' rise to power in the 00s, in order to separate West Bank and Gaza politically to prevent a secular-democratic solidarity movement that had the potential to end the occupation and solidify internationally recognized sovereignty.\n\nYou want to talk about that? We can talk about that. \n\nThe idea that Israel is some kind of moral agent in all this is absolutely absurd. It's just as absurd as thinking Hamas is a moral agent in all this. And it's unfortunate this breaks your brain.",

The justification for why it needs to be in Texas is that it's their indigenous homeland and they feel like it safe there, regardless of whether or not that's true. \n\nDo you or do you not support Tejanos ethnically cleansing Texas so they can have an ethno-state too? \n\n>No, if they move to a certain area and strongly seek independance because of just reasons (unlike the US civil war for example where the south sought seperation because they wanted to keep slaves) They should get an area where they live where they get those freedoms.\n\nThe conditions you laid out are already present currently. They were forced into specific areas, called reservations, and many would like  independence. \n\nTherefore since the conditions have already been met, your stated belief is that the United States relinquish the indigenous lands back to the indigenous tribes. \n\nSince the United States has held the same position that they won't, would you now be ok with another country taking control of the United States and forcing the land to be returned to the indigenous tribes so they can ethnically cleanse anyone not indigenous and form their own ethno-states? \n\nIf the answer is no, then you're not being consistent in your position. \n\n>The movement is not a strong movement, its not the priority in the lives of the people, and they didn't all move to a certain area where they could easily be given independance.\n\nYou don't know any rezzies do you? \n\nYou don't feel it's a strong movement because how are a few hundred thousand people supposed to take on the might of the United States government without any outside support? So then what would be the point. \n\nWhen Zionists declared their state of Israel, they had the full backing of the western powers that just finished fighting a global war. If Israel didn't have the military backing of the United States, Britain and France, they could not have ethnically cleansed Palestinians and declared the land Israel. \n\n>If everyone moved to south ohio(or whatever part of any land) and made it a priority to get independance there because they feel abused and treated differently than other americans, then I would support their independance.\n\nThe Navajo already occupy a consolidated territory in the tri-state area of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. It is a fact that the United States committed war crimes and acts of genocide against them. And it is a fact they still feel the effects of systemic racism. \n\nTherefore to remain consistent, you would necessarily support them, with the help of foreign militaries, declaring independence by force, ethnically cleansing the non-indigenous, and calling that self defense. \n\n>When you say ethnostate you mean something completely different from what I mean when I say the word ethnostate, so I can't really comment on that. I am against ethnostates according to my definition (and oxford definition) where citizenship it limited to a certain ethinicity, which doesn't apply to Israel.\n\nDictionary definitions are descriptive, not prescriptive. \n\nAll you're doing is making a semantic argument in order to avoid confirming that you in fact support laws and claims that declare one ethnicity above all others within a certain border. \"[Nation] is the nation of the [Ethnicity] people, and the [Ethnicity] people alone\".\n\nReplace Nation with Israel and Ethnicity with Jewish and that's a direct quote from Netanyahu. \n\n>I don't understand your definition since I understand you don't like the dictionary definition, so I don't even know what you say when you use that word.\n\nIt's not that I don't like dictionaries, that's just not how words work. Dictionaries don't tell us how to use words, but how words are commonly, but not exclusively, used.\n\nThis is a weasle tactic to avoid addressing the actual argument. You want to call legally declaring a nation for only one Ethnicity something else? Fine. It's a FloopyDooper-state. \n\nYou support FloopyDooper-states that declare one ethnicity superior to all others. \n\nDo you see how that doesn't affect my position  whatsoever and it doesn't change your position either? All we are doing is using a different word.\n\nAnd people who support FloopyDooper-states are supremacists just like people who support ethno-states (in your limited view of how you choose to define it)\n\nI also tried to look up ethno-state in the Oxford Dictionary and it doesn't exist. \n\nhttps://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?scope=Entries&q=ethnostate+\n\nAt least not on their official website. If you found that definiton, link it. I want to see it. \n\nBut I did find a definition for Ethno-nationalist, which describes a person who advocates for \"ethno-nations\" but no one says \"ethno-nation\", we say ethno-state.  \n\n>someone who fights to establish a new state or political order based on ethnic dominance or homogeneity.\n\nWow, look at that, nothing about citizenship. \n\nOh and look, it's an ideology based on ethnic dominance and homogeneity, which is part of the Israeli governments legal system and explicitly stated goals. \n\nI understand that you're dealing with a massive amount of cognitive dissonance right now, which is why your positions are inconsistent, you're constantly moving goalposts, and even resorted to appealing to authority (the dictionary), all to avoid admitting you support ethno-nationalism. Which is a supremacist position.",

The kid has to be in close proximity to the pager or holding it.  If the Kid is holding it, we know they have a close relationship with the owner of the pager (it is a pager handed down to them by Hezbolloah afterall), or some random kid is standing next to the guy with the exploding pager.  Either way, no matter how you cut this, the responsibility lies in the guy who is a member of Hezbolloah.",

It would also be impossible to ensure compliance with the proportionality rule. Indiscriminate attacks defined under Article 51 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, an attack is considered indiscriminate if it is not directed at a specific military objective **or if it employs a method or means of combat that cannot be controlled** to limit its effects as required by IHL.\n\nBut thanks for saying with your full chest you're ok with war crimes as long as it's against brown people.",

End the occupation and provide reparations to restore enough quality of life that people don't feel the need to join fundamentalist terrorist organizations. \n\nIt's so telling that you don't view these people as human beings. We are no psychologically different than them. If you were placed in those same material conditions, you too would be a terrorist. We know exactly what creates terrorism. \n\n>And you think this because you think Israel\u2019s very existence is a crime\n\nTheir actions are criminal. I think ethno-states are immoral. But I don't claim that ethno-states are criminal. \n\n>You view the Jewish State as a criminal enterprise, a vile, law-defying blot not only on the Middle East but also on the reputation of humankind itself.\n\nLike any other regime, profiting from crimes, I would say that's a criminal enterprise. Any ethno-state I view as a disgrace to humankind itself. Same for any religious state. I don't care what ethnicity or what religion. This would include any potential state controlled by Hamas or Hezbollah, by the way. \n\n>When you harbour such intense, irrational hatred for one nation, it is a short step to telling that nation to down its weapons, lower its defences and let itself be attacked.\n\nMy positions of supporting the Geneva conventions and international human rights laws, as well as opposing religious or ethno-states and colonization are all rational. \n\nBut I'm open to hearing why you oppose the Geneva conventions and international human rights laws while supporting, the correct kind, of religious states, ethno-states, and colonization. Is it a deep irrational hatred of brown people?  \n\nIt's funny because not once have I stated support for Hezbollah or Hamas, yet you assumed I do because you still see this conflict as good guys vs bad guys, rather than bad guys vs bad guys vs the rest of us.

Each attack by definition is indiscriminate.\n\nTherefore, they have no way of detonating the device in a way that complies with obligations.\n\nWhich is why Israel will not accept responsibility for this attack. Unlike with a missile, there is no possible way to say that your intel was bad or the device malfunctioned.\n\n\u2010------\n\nAs an aside, as you've stated this does demonstrate that there are ways that Israel could operate within Gaza without shelling refugee camps, targeting humanitarian aids workers and sniping children.

But whether or not it is effective does not necessitate it being legal or moral.\n\nI would add that the strikes from Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants also propogate attacks with disregard for civilian casualties/deliberate targeting of civilians - but Hezbollah is a proscribed terrorist organisation and Israel is the ally of my country.",

The average airstrike kills less than 1 person. The Palestinian population has grown over the past year, not shrunk. More food is getting in via aid than pre Oct 7th. <50 people have starved in an intense urban war, when the default for war is often much much higher.",

The settlers there are religious fanatics who have no intention of leaving. And exactly, what land is there to swap? The colonies built on Palestinian lands have been expanding since Oslo (hell, they were being expanded upon during that talks) and they are constructed in a scattered way, which has fragmented Palestinian territory, making a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. \n\nAdditionally, the settlers who left under the administration of Ariel Sharon did so because they were offered biblical land, hence referring to as Judea and Samaria. They are not likely to move an inch and I doubt the Israeli government will force them off their land. The ones who left Gaza were given a 100,000 Shekels to relocate to the West Bank, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to uproot their settlements again. \n\nEven with a land swap proposal, there isn\u2019t a clear roadmap as to how a Palestinian state would be created. The land offered to Palestinians would most likely be uninhabitable, while places like Jerusalem, which are close to heart of the issue, will continue to be under Israeli control.\n\nRegarding your last comment: this is genocide denial. Israel is openly targeting and killing civilians, men, women, and children, along with using starvation as a weapon of war. The unofficial death toll is much higher than what\u2019s reported and if you like I can list a human rights reports.\n\nEdit: lmao at the comment that an average airstrike killing one person. Even if that were true, the complete destruction of critical infrastructure ensures a slow painful death, or at the very least a lifetime of misery.",

Don't pretend airstikes with too little regard for civilian caught in the crossfire are anywhere near the same thing as \"targeting civilians\". It's so gross misusing the word genocide and honestly disrespectful towards the actual victims of genocide.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Even if that were true\". Israel had well over 50k strikes.

At the time of the Gaza \u201cdisengagement\u201d, there were only about 8 or 9 thousand settlers, while the over Palestinian population was around a million. The logistics of moving close to 10,000 people is a lot simpler than moving close to a million, including the 200,000 or so in East Jerusalem. The Israeli government isn\u2019t going to risk upsetting the fanatics like Ben Gvir or Smotrich that wield significant political influence, especially, as I mentioned, the settlers are ideologically and religiously driven to erase Palestinians from the lands. The settlers in Gaza at the time were nowhere near as deeply entrenched in the Israeli political establishment. \n\nOne point you failed to realize about Gaza is that the strip of land is tiny and densely populated and not as strategic as the West Bank is. Israel doesn\u2019t really want Gaza, which is why they\u2019re grinding it into dust. Additionally, Israel continued its occupation over the Gaza Strip by controlling its borders, airspace, and access to water. The West Bank on the other hand is of strategic value to Israel as it\u2019s closer to Jerusalem, arable lands, and military positioning. Disengaging from the West Bank would mean that settlers would be giving up the billions invested in roads, housing, schools, checkpoints, and all sorts of infrastructure. If Israel was actually serious about leveraging the West Bank for a two-state solution, it would not have accelerated the growth of settlements in the area lol. So this argument is not a realistic or a serious one. \n\nAlso, here\u2019s another reason for the Gaza disengagement: \n\n\u201cBut \u2018disengagement\u2019 had another purpose: to enable Israel\u2019s air force to bomb Gaza at will, something they could not do when Israeli settlers lived there.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n12/adam-shatz/israel-s-descent\n\nNow to your second argument - Hamas targets civilians, Israel doesn\u2019t. Yes, Hamas carried out war crimes and should held accountable. However; Israel is far worse and is the reason for the existence of an organization like Hamas. Israel has indiscriminately targeted, killed, and maimed more than 40,000 Palestinians (probably way more) because it targets schools, homes, hospitals, bakeries, water supplies, nurseries and any imaginable infrastructures. Israel makes claims about Hamas using civilian infrastructure, however; the ethnonationalist state lies openly and repeatedly. Example, Al Shifa hospital, where Israel claimed (using animation) that there was a military compound below, and it turned out to be nonexistent. \n\nSecondly, this is an asymmetrical war, where Gazan\u2019s are locked in a prison creating an environment, where it\u2019s easy to kill civilians. It\u2019s a 25km strip of land not very far to go. For the record, these tactics were used by the Vietcong, Warsaw uprising and even by Jewish groups in Palestine. If you think Hamas\u2019 use of civilian area is indefensible, what\u2019s your excuse for Israel?\n\nMilitary base in Tel Avis: https://archive.ph/awYYv\nIsrael\u2019s use of human shields: https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-armys-use-palestinian-civilians-human-shields-has-been-documented-large-scale\n\nBlaming this on Hamas is gaslighting, and it\u2019s the language/arguments of the abuser. October 7 was indeed a crime, but in the words of the attack \u201cdid not happen in a vacuum.\u201d\n\nNow with regards to targeting civilians, I\u2019ll leave you with this:\n\n\u201cI had children who were shot twice,\u201d said Dr. Mark Perlmutter, who said he was in Gaza at the end of April and the first couple weeks of May. \u201cI have two children that I have photographs of that were shot so perfectly in the chest I couldn\u2019t put my stethoscope over their heart more accurately and directly on the side of the head in the same child.\u201d\n\nPerlmutter added, \u201cNo toddler gets shot twice by mistake by \u2018the world\u2019s best snipers.\u2019 And they\u2019re dead-center shots.\u201d\n\nhttps://news.antiwar.com/2024/07/22/american-surgeon-who-volunteered-in-gaza-says-idf-snipers-shoot-toddlers/",

It includes 11,355 children, 2,955 people aged 60 or older, and 6,297 women. There are also many civilian men of fighting age who have been killed.\n\nIsrael claims it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death9 to the 37\u2009396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186\u2009000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2\u2009375\u2009259, this would translate to 7\u00b79% of the total population in the Gaza Strip. A report from Feb 7, 2024, at the time when the direct death toll was 28\u2009000, estimated that without a ceasefire there would be between 58\u2009260 deaths (without an epidemic or escalation) and 85\u2009750 deaths (if both occurred) by Aug 6, 2024.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext\n\nRegarding the large firefight that took place in the hospital.

There is something VASTLY different than a military HQ in a city with clear markings and physical separation from civilian structure, and building tunnels under UN buildings, firing rockets out of children's play areas, and not wearing uniforms/marking military structures.",

At the same time, the massive construction of new buildings and facilities recently is tantamount to adding crime to punishment, so to speak, because it was carried out in full knowledge of the dangers to all the close surroundings \u200f(which include saliently civilian objects\u200f). The new construction should have taken place outside Tel Aviv. If and when new facilities and buildings are constructed, they should be placed outside the urban area, in accordance with Article 58\u200f(b\u200f). It is regrettable, even surprising, that no significant public debate has taken place in Israel on this subject.\u201d",

Like sending in drones with loudspeaker, sending millions of texts, tens of thousands of calls, and creating detailed maps to help civilians evacuate?

A death ratio that's is well within the norms of other dense urban conflicts, despite Hamas being by far the worst with war crimes that increase civilian deaths?

Life expectancy, employment, and healthcare access was going up. Show people an alternative path to terror, and Israel will loosen its hold on the territories. The \"status quo\" needs to be a long path towards deradicalization on both sides and not some idealistic overnight solution.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNo the logical conclusion for non morally corrupt people is to separate the two parties so they won't kill each other.

You make this sound like it was a choice made by Israel - not a concession after multiple investigations found Israel was responsible for hundreds of aid workers being killed from organizations like WCK and the RC. Most of these deaths occurred by targeted missiles hitting established aid locations - to claim it was unintentional is bull shit. To paint this as a positive step taken by Israel, and not any obvious walkback to killing hundreds of aid workers for the world to see is disgustingly biased.\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2024/05/14/gaza-israelis-attacking-known-aid-worker-locations\n\nIsrael does warn certain regions to evacuate - this is true. However, Israel has also on multiple occasions then conducted air strikes on the very same evacuation zones a couple of days later. Again, why are you painting this as a win. This is a war crime. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip_evacuations#:~:text=On%2020%20December%2C%20Israel%20ordered,Balah%20was%20hit%20by%20airstrikes.\n\nGenocide as understood by the UN includes several different acts, in which Israel has been accused of multiple - both in Gaza and the West Bank. Does that mean it is accurate? Nope. But given that Israel doesn't allow for foreign investigations of their crimes... I don't think anyone has a leg to stand on here.\n\nhttps://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976\n\nPrior to October 7th, Palestinians were still second class citizens. The only difference really is scale. Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were still being killed every year - or thousands in some years. West Bank settlements were still being set up, with the IDF sanctioning the violent theft of land (war crime). You paint a very rosy picture, but do you have data of Israeli action to back that up? All I see are multiple reports of further denigrating conditions after previous imposition made that are consistent of an apartheid regime:\n\nhttps://www.unicef.org/mena/documents/gaza-strip-humanitarian-impact-15-years-blockade-june-2022\n\nBasically, are you claiming Israel actually helped Palestinians? OR, are you saying Israel had to walk back certain policies (e.g., withholding food/water) after international pressure, and then painting that as a positive sign of improvement?\n\nWhat offer to peace has Israel offered in the last 20 years that doesn't include the continuation of occupation in the West Bank - which solution has even made a good faith attempt to adhere to international law and immediately remove ALL occupation in the West Bank - both military and civilian? \n\nThe two state solution you keep falling back to is one that would have needed to be carried out in the Oslo Accords 1 or 2. However violent opposition on both sides - led to Israel's supporter being assassinated by Zionist extremists and Hamas to spoil the well for Palestinians. Nettenyahu - who had supported Hamas for this very reason - was who stepped up afterwards. To propose a 2 state solution with EITHER party still in power (Hamas or Bibi) is disingenuous. But realistically, even if both were removed, it's too late. Israel is now deeply entrenched in both Gaza and the West Bank - there is no way they could (or would) offer genuine autonomy to either zone, even if Hamas was disbanded. \n\nHere is a basic break down of peace negotiations - but if you are aware of one in the last year that includes giving Palestine full autonomy to ALL regions within Gaza and West Bank upon doing X, please enlighten me...\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/22/23971375/israel-palestine-peace-talks-deal-timeline\n\nBut I would also like point out even these conditions are still biased - why is Hamas the only criminal in this? They certainly are one. But can we agree ANY combatant who intentionally targets civilians is criminal? If so, then we can't just sit here and pretend IDF is innocent. I've outlined some examples, and I'd happily provide as many as you want. The reality is that regardless of whatever crime you want to hold Hamas activity to - murder, rape, theft, etc. - The IDF outnumbers this significantly. Pick one and I'll indulge. But if you adopt a bad faith argument - that the IDF is not guilty of the same crimes due to some arbitrary justification - I will ignore it entirely. As this has been a stunningly bad faith false dichotomy I have often seen engaged in when it comes to evaluating the actions of different groups. \n\nFor example - if Hamas were to conduct an air strike in Tel Aviv that kills 5 IDF members and 200 civilians, is that \"collateral damage\", or is that \"terrorism\"?",

Stop acting like they didn't earn the right to their own self determination. What did the Zionists do? They promised to guard the Suez Canal and there were some effective spies against the Turks.\n\nThe only difference with Palestine vs the other mandates is that the UK promised Mandatory Palestine to BOTH the Zionists and the Arabs, obviously for religious reasons. Zionists at the time had no real claim to the land as many of that small population (not counting the Semitic jews that had lived there for centuries and were usually not zionist) immigrated from Europe when the Ottoman Empire authorized them to set up communities during the 19th century, but it was given to them to prevent jews from migrating to the UK, gain global jewish support for WW1 because ally Russian was incredibly anti-jewish, and sprinkle in some Christian zionism. Leave it to Balfour to acknowledge that he promised the land to both groups, especially when the Arabs were not aware of the promise to the zionists. Then there was a ban on any kind of communication/newspapers for Arabs for 2 years while the Zionists got a chance to take every opportunity to organize. What is WEIRD is that ANY land got promised to people (Zionists) that ultimately recently immigrated to the area and weren't even 10% of the population. What's WEIRD is that the reason they got land at all was because of Arthur Balfour, also a Christian Zionist, convincing the British war cabinet:\n\n\u201cIn Palestine \u2026 we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country. Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land.\u201d -Balfour\n\nYou can also point the terrorism accusation at the world's most technically advanced, \"most moral\" terrorist group, the IDF. There are people that are (or were) still alive and lived through the Nakba. They still have the keys to their houses. You guys throwing the \"it was 80 years ago schtick\" is such a laugh when Israel will never offer the right of return to the people they terrorized out of their homes. Israel is literally waiting for these refugees to die off (or not waiting and blowing them up) because it suits their interests and deteriorates their claim to their homes and farmland. Have you even looked at the report that Israel itself put out when it was sniping the elderly, children, and purposefully maiming limbs when Gazans peacefully marched during their great march of return at their own border?

Peacefully protestors leave when a riot breaks out. And a significant portion killed by the IDF during the protests were in fact militants, as admitted to by both Hamas and the PIJ.",

The same way Israel's citizens would face repercutions for refusing to serve, people who live in areas controlled by those organizations don't have much of a say in whether they   serve or not this organization. Sometimes they might even do it to have food and a roof over their heads. Now, might it be in the minority in the case of Hezbollah, compared to Israel? Maybe, I don't have numbers for that, but it is disingenous to claim every member of a military faction supports their actions and are there out of free will, instead of necessity.",

I'm not a military strategist, so I don't really have a good tactical answer, but I don't think bombing the entire country to rubble is a good idea practically speaking.\nIt's the entire reason guerilla wars are so hard to fight, because the actual enemy can launch a rocket, then leave the location before anyone can return fire, so any retaliation will have a high risk of killing civilains with a lower chance of actually killing the enemy.\nLeaving aside the morality of killing civilians, doing so looks bad on the world stage, and is a great recruiting tool for terrorist organizations. \n\nI think part of the reason there is so little outcry against strikes against Israel is because isreal has such a huge advantage in technology. A large number of the rockets are shot down before they hit anything, so a lot less people die from rockets than would be the case if they were fired the other direction. I think people see the power dynamic and just kind of naturally brush off the attacks from the weaker power. Even if they don't actively support them, they're much easier to ignore. To be clear, I'm not saying this is morally right or just.",

If there was weapons inside the hospital, then yes, you could target it, and the staff would have been considered collateral damage, but you could not gun down all the doctors while they were at home because they just so happened to work on top of an ammo dump.",

The presence of the pagers in the hospital wouldn\u2019t mean necessarily that the hospital is being used in a way that would release the prohibition. Because again, there is no possible way to know who is carrying it and what activities they are carrying out.  It could be with a wounded soldier, which would absolutely be a war crime no matter that persons status prior to being wounded. They may have known who was supposed to get them, but they had no control once they were in the enemies hands. Not even Mossad could predict this. It\u2019s the unknown that is what makes this likely illegal and that\u2019s what they are pointing out. Also, the exception for the hospitals in Gaza is not settled yet. Israel has been proven to lie and hide things from the international community. They already tated that there were zero civilian casualties and we know that\u2019s not true. That being said, if they were telling the truth about Hamas attacking from those hospitals, they committed plenty of war crimes in relation to the attacks anyway so it wouldn\u2019t matter if the decision to attack was a war crime or not. If you attack a hospital that is legitimately not protected as a healthcare facility anymore, you have to give a warning beforehand and allow the patients to be evacuated first. The patients would likely not ever be allowed to be evacuated, but it is a stipulation of the law. You also have a duty to care for the patients in that hospital once you have carried out the attack. Israel did not do either of those things. They also killed civilians in the surrounding neighborhood. Which is also likely a war crime. Hamas is committing war crimes as well, but their terrorists and international law is what sets us apart from them.",

I\u2019m not an expert in international law, but I do have a degree in military history. My first thought was this exact thing. International law has a formula for civilian casualties and this attack definitely falls within those ranges, probably by a lot actually. That\u2019s not the only thing the law says though. It requires you to be able to predict what those casualties are beforehand. It\u2019s impossible to do that with this type of attack for the reasons that you mentioned above. You also have to consider the terror component of this type of attack which  is a violation of international law too although that one is more subjective and harder to prove. I think that Israel can and should use more precise targeting in Gaza, but this has nothing to do with that. It is not a targeted or precision attack by any means. If the casualties are unpredictable, then that is the opposite of precision. You can\u2019t have both. It is a pretty ingenious way of committing a war crime though, I will give them that. \nI\u2019m very sure they will never be held accountable for it though.",

There will have to be an investigation to know for sure, but I will say this. I don\u2019t know your background, but this is not a targeted attack at all. They weren\u2019t soldiers on a military base. They were combatants for sure so they were legitimate military targets. It\u2019s the uncertainty of where they would be when they were detonated that is the problem in my opinion because as I\u2019ve said before, you have to be able to reasonably guarantee that the civilian/ combatant casualty ratio is going to be within the law before the attack. You can\u2019t do that with this type of attack and nothing you have said has sufficiently proved that you can. I can cite the law if you would like.\n\nAs far as land mines go. I see you baited me here so good on you. I will say that Israel is restricted in land mine use by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. They also have self imposed a moratorium on their use. That is all beside the fact because what you have said her is very telling.\n\nYou brought up land mines to compare them to this attack as a way to say that this attack is ok because land mines are ok. Or the other way around more specifically which is really the same thing. The whole world basically recognizes land mines as morally wrong. Even Israel because they have passed multiple laws banning their use and creating a government agency whose sole purpose is to clear mines. So even the Israelis see mines as morally wrong in general and specifically in their conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah where there is evidence an astonishing amount of war crimes has been committed by both sides. So since you are the one who tied land mine use to this, why would one be universally considered morally wrong and illegal in most cases and the other wouldn\u2019t be? Even if this turns out to be legal, which only a court can decide, it\u2019s worth questioning. It\u2019s especially worth questioning the morality of new types of attacks when they happen because not only do methods of war change, but so do social mores. Also, I\u2019m not arguing that this attack is illegal under that convention. You brought up land mines and I responded with the standard treaty that applies to that. You are correct that Israel is exempt, but Israel wasn\u2019t mentioned in your comment so I answered in a general way that applies to the most countries. Israel is constrained by the agreements I\u2019m discussing though and they can certainly suffer consequences. As far as other countries in the region taking these things seriously, I just have to point out that Israel is in the Middle East. They aren\u2019t looking for the support from the west that Israel is and so it doesn\u2019t matter what other countries do. This also will be decided by a court not in the Middle East so I\u2019m not sure why that is even relevant information. You can\u2019t defend yourself in court by saying the other guy got away with it so I should too.",

As you've accurately said, there is a high degree of certainty that people holding these pagers are combatants and targetable. \nThe explosives have a known, fairly predictable, size/capability. There can only be so many people in a given space, so it seems fairly trivial to calculate a worst case and likely case casualty rate for this attack, and determine proportionality that way.\n\nGiven the small size of the explosive, I wouldn't be surprised if it was still proportional to use it in a worse case proportionality situation (inside an elevator or bus). Given the size of the explosive I struggle to imagine a situation which would not be proportional if we accept that the targets are combatants and the attack is likely to do significant damage to Hezbollah communications.",

That\u2019s not even the biggest problem with this suggestion though.

GPS wouldn\u2019t tell them who is around them. Or if that person was driving a car. if that person was holding a baby. They also detonated them almost simultaneously which would mean they weren\u2019t monitoring their location in order to detonate them at the right time because then they would have been detonated at different times. This is not a precision attack and because of the lack of a meaningful ability to predict casualties, it\u2019s most likely a war crime. One of those people could have been injured and taken to a hospital. It is a war crime to attack the wounded. Especially in a hospital. So if you can\u2019t predict the number of casualties within a reasonable margin of error especially if it\u2019s possible a a causality could be a war crime because of uncontrollable variables, then the attack itself is likely a war crime because you have to be able to predict that your attack won\u2019t be a war crime.

The attacks by definition heavily discriminated between civilian and military targets: the only people the pagers were distributed to were military. Given some other assumptions, such as knowledge of rules about keeping pagers by them at all times, and maybe some metrics about how many members keep such devices on their person normally, you can come away with a percentage of likelihood the pager will be with a military target. These percentages would follow the same rules as other metrics of deciding when it is okay to bomb a target, for example.\n\ni.e. \"hezbollah members in the data recorded so far have their military hats on their person 99% of the time, and when their hats are not on their person, 76% of the time they are in a military zone.\" You can use this data to orchestrate a discriminate attack by planting explosives in their hats with similar levels of effective prediction to targeted rocket attacks.",

If Hamas was to do this to a single residential building that had an Israeli soldier in it it would he called terrorism, but Israel does it to 80% of all residential buildings, 80% of all healthcare facilities, 80% of all schools without ever proving there was a militant in one of them. \n\nSo yea anything the IDF says like \u201cwe were targeting Hezbollah\u201d that does not mean anything to me, I will assume its a lie, because they are proven to have the impunity and power to lie and smear and slur their victims. In my mind Israel is a terrorist state whose primary purpose is to terrorize their enemies through indiscriminate violence primarily targeting civilians, any militants they kill are not targeted and are just collateral damage.",

And then move onto the next one.\n\nEvery consequence Israel faces should be faced twice as much by the US in my opinion, and to some people it will, but the lower common denominator masses will be scapegoated onto Israel or even Judaism which is why it is antisemitic imo to conflate Israel with Judeism. To me its a cynical antisemitic trollish scapegoat to protect primarily the US weapon manufacturers and politicians.\n\nBut yes Israel does have that power/impunity and has been using it since it began, how many of the 80% of residential buildings, healthcare facilities or schools etc have they proved were being housed by militants? I have not seen a single drone or satellite video footage proving this even once. Meanwhile there is tons of raw video of them bombing ambulances and civilians with zero repercussions.",

I think its a stretch to even say every single Palestinian who entered Israel in Oct 7 shoukd get that guilt by association, unless you consider going in intending to get hostages terrorism which is valid. But even then, say by guilt of association everyone who entered Israel on Oct 7 is a terrorist and deserves justice even without a trial, that doesnt include every single person in Palestine who could be considered a militant, not just by age but even by intent. Like if someone never killed a civilian but is fighting drones snd tanks with a rusty ak in their holocoust skeleton city, that person isnt a terrorist.\n\nAnd if the ratio is generally true that Israel kills 7 women or children for every \u201cterrorist\u201d that would mean they are killing 7 women and children for whatever unknown fraction of the 3 remaining men went into Israel on Oct 7, probably a tiny percentage. But that isnt what they really mean they put such a wide envelope on who is a terrorist that I think they consider even wounded children with no surviving family future terrorists, let alone any militant. So its a genocidal cycle.",

It was that with this attack specifically, you cannot as an operative trigger the explosives while also assessing whether your attacks will either be effective or done with minimal collateral.\n\nMostly replying because you said \"combat ant\" and that made me smile.

Discrimination can be proven overwhelmingly.\n\nJust to give you the steelman: the argument here is not civilians could be w/in blast radius, the argument is that Hezbollah could've given these out to, like, the guy who does payroll or who edits the video montages & those guys aren't lawful combatants. That's the strong argument when it comes to targeting.\n\nThe more pertinent IHL is CCW Prot 2, Art. 3, which says that civilians cannot be the target (check) & the harm to civilian population cannot outweigh the military advantage conferred (check).\n\nhttps://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/ccw-amended-protocol-ii-1996/article-3?activeTab=\n\nYou could argue that Art. 5 of this convention, which prevents booby-trapping \"harmless portable objects,\" is applicable, but given we are talking about military communications equipment I think that would be an extraordinary stretch.\n\nRather than write everything at length, I encourage review of this write-up, which is sufficiently cautious & nuanced but generally arrives at the conclusion this does not appear to breach IHL: https://lieber.westpoint.edu/exploding-pagers-law/",

So 20% is wrong. Reuters reports that the other 8 you are referencing were all Hezbollah.\n\nGiven that the entire reason they moved to pagers was to secure military communication. Why would they pass these things out to random people? How many times have you been handed an MBITR or PRC124 that was actively capable of encrypted communications by your government as a random person? I'm betting never.\n\nTo give or let random people posses them is the opposite of they got them.",

There were people who were unfortunate enough to be standing next to someone with a Hezbollah pager who are innocent, but framing this as some sort of indiscriminate attack really downplays the sophistication of (presumably) Mossad's operation.\n\nThe kid who died went to grab her dad's pager when it started going off... and her dad is a high-ranking member of Hezbollah.\n\nThere were ~2000 pagers that detonated when that signal went out. Casualties are floating around ~3000.\n\nSo, for every one civilian wounded, two *ranking members* of Hezbollah were taken out. That's pretty surgical if you ask me... a lot better than drone strikes.",

You sent me three articles, to assure that your case is stronger, while both of them cite the same source, US government official that said that it \u201cappeared\u201d that the detonations started after a message sent from Hezbollah leadership.\n\nSo we got a source which I won\u2019t really call unbiased, making a weak and vague claim. Nowhere in those articles does it say that ONLY the devices that received that message (not a \u201ccall to arms signal\u201d that you described, just a message) exploded.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that an article you linked also mentions that the explosions kept going for an HOUR after that (why would that happen with a \u201ccall to arms signal\u201d?), all of them mention civilian casualties in public spaces, which you don\u2019t seem to note.\n\nI won\u2019t give you a source because I don\u2019t have a claim that needs it here, I question your statement that you backed up with quite a dubious collection of sources that never exactly supports the statement I had a problem with, your \u201cuniversal Hezbollah call to arms signal\u201d.\n\nI have no interest to discuss this further, just want you to know that you\u2019re not as rational about this as you think you are.

There's an obvious security downside to Hezbollah restricting that model of pager to Hezbollah members, because that means that if you have the pager you're a member. That's well within the known capabilities of spy satellites to identify, and means you have an obvious membership badge if Israel invades and finds one in your house.\n\nLike, imagine it from the other perspective: you're a fed trying to run an undercover sting operation. Do you make it so that feds all have to use Blackberries and are the only ones legally allowed to?",

Claiming Hezbollah is part of the civilian leadership doesn't excuse them, it makes it worse, because now you have connected the ENTIRETY of Lebanon to the crime and not just Hezbollah as an organization. It doesn't matter if it's just \"part\" of the government, it's still a government entity committing military hostile action against another country, that's all it needs for a valid case of war of defense... otherwise I could instruct my military to attack another country and just go \"Oops looks my military has gone rogue. Silly me. But it's not us the civilian leadership, so don't you dare counter-attack!\"\n\nAlso \"harmless objects\" means civilian objects. What is civilian and what isn't depends entirely on what an item is used for. If a Ford Prius is used by the an organization for military purposes than that specific Prius is a military asset and subject to that regulation. It doesn't matter that 99.99% of Ford Priuses are civilian then. Because otherwise I could just equip my military with civilian tools across the board and then claim \"war crimes\" if the enemy bombs them.\n\nAll rules of war utterly DEPEND on clear separation of military and civilian assets, it's probably the single most important rule of the Geneva conventions because pretty much every other rule depends on it. So the moment a force no longer visually separates their military from their civilians the entire Geneva Conventions completely fall apart.",

Whether Israrel or Hezbolla commits war crimes does not justify conversant war crimes.\n\nA medic in the Israeli Defence Force being killed or maimed by combatants is unlawful in the same way that non-combatant medics who work in Hezbolla operated hospitals are to be protected by international law.\n\nThe car detail is a very blurred line, and yes, you could argue that. In fact, Israel did commit a war crime in Gaza in which a child's family was killed in a car, and then the ambulance services who went out to reach that child (Hind Rajab) were then bombed subsequently as a honey trap. Very much a war crime there.\n\nOn the other hand, a pager is generally non-lethal (I frequently use pagers them in my line of work in a hospital). If a hospital doctor, nurse or pharmacist is provided with pagers by Hezbolla, are they guilty of terrorism by association and are worthy targets to be provided tampered weapons? Would I be a valid target for the same kind of attack if say, for instance, my government sent an army to a foreign country and commited a massacre as part of a coup attempt?\n\nInternational law applies equally to civilians in war zones and non-war zones if they are ratified members. Of course, Israel will unlikely be subject to any real charges of war crimes so long as it is protected by the United States.\n\nYou're right that military and civilian assets are meant to be separated one another, and that's precisely why Israel is in the wrong here. We are making assumptions that these targets have been distinguished in the same way that a sniper might target a lawful enemy combatant. You cannot visualise who has pagers and who does not. This makes it plausibly indiscriminate even if all best intentions is not to harm civilians.\n\nThe effect also instilling terror into the civilians is plausibly state terror under international law. Nothing new for either counterparty.\n\nJust like each robbery or murder or traffic offense is treated separately under the laws of the jurisdiction it applies to, each military action that may fall under the auspices of war crimes must be viewed dispassionately in that same way also.",

Homophobia and misogyny are not valid arguments in this case.\n\nI interpret that you do not care to distinguish non-combatant Hezbolla, combatant Hezbolla or just non-involved Lebanese civilians because of this issue. But this is the precise question that needs to be answered, and the only question that really any one cares about from a humanitarian point of view. If there were few to no civilian casualties (thousands maimed or injured) or deaths and objective evidence that there was care and consideration done to avoid harm to non-combatants, then we would not be having this discussion whatsoever.\n\nIt is precisely that Israel and its war and espionage apparatus have not commented on their involvement that makes this contentuous, because plausible deniability protects them so long as their involvement is kept ambiguous. If Israel is clearly not trying to harm civilians as you argue (but you also make it clear that you don't care), they should probably own up to the attack and present their case that they aren't targetting civilians.\n\nIn fact, your feelings would make it entirely valid for Hezbolla or Hamas to attack Israeli civilians because the Israel government has imposed itself on Palestine for nearly eight decades now and their track record of human rights is abysmal by all accounts against the Palestinan people. I mean, nearly all Jewish citizens are IDF conscripts and arguably therefore even more valid as targets as you can argue that they have been involved in the illegal occupation of Palestine in West Bank and its current occupation in Gaza. More recently, we know of Sde Teiman which has been alleged to be their Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib.\n\nRegarding how you view their authoritarian flavour, to take it closer to home in Western civilisation -- should we accept terroristic attacks on USA states that have criminalised termination of pregnancies because of how states have invoked states rights on the overturrning of Roe v. Wade? I mean, you can argue that these women are now essentially mandatory incubators.\n\nIf you are going to use a liberal leaning argument like Hezbolla are homophobic or misogynistic, then remember to apply that kind of thinking towards those who are not direct parties involved in the calamity -- I mean, that's the flavour that you're giving off as a justification.",

What the poster you're responding to is pointing out is, due to the nature of the attack, the people detonating had no way to know who else was around when they detonated. Could've been in the middle of field harming no one but the carrier. Could've been in a Hezbollah bunker taking out multiple legitimate targets. Could've been in the middle of a mall or park and killed unrelated innocent children. \n\nThis is quite different from your rocket launcher example because they not only could, but are likely to be carrying the pager in public while on what would appear to be normal business. Any normal civilian sees a guy with a rocket launcher, they're going to get out. A guy with a pager on his belt, assuming its visible at all, would not be cause for alarm. Its hardly cause for a second look.\n\nYou turned this into \"If they stole their equipment among civilians...\" but that's not the discussion. First, if they did store it among civilians and Isreal knew that information, they would not be legally justified in carrying out the attack,  because then they knew civilians would get hurt. But where they stored it isn't relevant because expected usage is the question, not storage. The pagers being on Hezbollah personal is expected, but where they are when you choose to detonate is up in the air. And it could very easily have been among a bunch of unrelated civilians. So the attacks meet the legal definition of indescriminate; you can't discriminate if you don't know the circumstances in the first place. You see the distinction?",

If you can order a strike from that grocery store using a pager... Well? By active I meant Hezbollah was actively firing rockets within hours of this operation. No one really thinks that a sniper shooting the in command general of an army on his way to dinner is a war crime.\n\nI guess for me, you'd have to show these pagers where otherwise civilian devices are used frequently by all members for civilian purposes. But even Hezbollah hasn't said that. Civilians and military personnel sending civilian messages use cell phones. Not encrypted pagers.",

Civilian casualties per hostile combatant are extremely low.\n\nLegally it's almost all on Hezbollah not Israel. The ICRC is written this way for a specific reason. The law is pretty simple: if you engage in combat related operations around civilians you're responsible for their deaths. This prevents complex games around proportionality (your grenade risked more civilian lives than my rifle). If you are standing around civilians firing, communicating, and participating in war in any way it's your fault when they die (by law).\n\nStrategically? It's really hard to say. Certainly Israel didn't improve its standing with its Arab partners... But those partners don't seem to care. It had a huge impact on Hezbollah though.",

That is fucking *widely* agreed after the fact to have been horrible, unjustified, and even unjustifiable. The firebombing is less contentious than the nuclear bombs, in my experience. If anybody but the U.S. had won the war, people would likely have been charged for that.\n\nEdit: Yeah, not what it sounded like you were saying and it's odd to cite one of the more obvious atrocities as defense of this.",

Israel would have been in violation of the LOAC if they had sabotaged a random shipment of pagers going into Lebanon, without trying to ascertain whether the pagers were ordered by Hezbollah or civilians. \n\nIn fact, the entire reason Israel chose pagers as the delivery device, rather than mobile phones, is because that's what Hezbollah was using as their secret military communication devices.

I think you're pointing out that, once the pagers did explode, there was a risk that they would hit people near the Hezbollah members, and would not *further* be able to discriminate between civilians near Hezbollah members and combatants near Hezbollah members, of course--but this type of risk is unavoidable. Bullets also do not discriminate once fired, so if a civilian happens to jump out in front of a combatant, yes, a civilian can die, but the attack was targeted, the intended target was a combatant, and the risk of collateral damage was relatively minimal to the damage done to the target (international law allows the attacker to make this calculation within some degree of reason).",

I can't begin to argue for or against any side in the terrible, divisive history between Israel and its neighbors, but when it is clear that the organization orchestrating not domestic terrorism, but a missile attack INTO one's country...I can't really blame Israel for operating a covert and mass-scale bombing of military personnel in retaliation. And another retaliation will come in response, and another until one side or the other is wiped out or conquered.\n\nAnd that's difficult for me to write because ethically I believe that an end to ALL violence is the best course of action, if we were dealing with governing bodies who sought peace. But we aren't. What we've witnessed over the past many decades is a prolonged regional (and at times cross-regional) war. We're dealing with fundamentally opposed ideologies, divided along geographic and philosophic lines who simply cannot live in harmony with one another unless the unimaginable were to happen: a generations-long peace and forgiveness or a unanimously-accepted reconciliation that wiped the record clean.\n\nI believe that simply hasn't been proven to be within human nature. And that isn't to say we shouldn't try - but between nations of relatively similar size and capabilities the singularly-most-common end to hostilities is when one side demolishes and subjugates the other. We saw it in both world wars. We've seen it in most regional wars as well. I don't think any human being alive would say it would be appropriate to take attack after attack after attack after attack, and return with no hostilities whatsoever. It's just not in us to be attacked in such a way and be forgiving for it - and those who can are an extreme rarity. There simply isn't any means of devised warfare - aside from lining both sides up on a battlefield and having them shoot at each other - where \"innocent\" casualties are guaranteed to be zero.

Just range. What is an acceptable range of civilian casualties compared to military objectives?\"\n\nI think anything above 20% is usually unjustifiable. I also think the methodology is just as important as the end numbers, because sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you get unlucky. putting explosives into normal everyday objects like that is a war crime for a reason....",

This is part of the planning process. According to international law, any members of a terrorist organization that participate in the planning or preparation of attacks are not civilians.\n\nRegardless, Hezbollah, as a whole, is a terrorist organization. They are designated as such and operate in a manner that fits within the definitions of terrorism from the UNSC and the EU based on the fact that it uses violence and terror against civilians in furtherance of its political goals. The operation targeted a terrorist organization by targeting the devices they use to plan attacks. They are not required to differentiate between alleged civilian members of the organization, even though they attempted to by only targeting the devices used to plan attacks. They are required to differentiate between the civilian population of Lebanon and terrorist organizations, which is what they did.\n\nJust because Hezbollah as a whole is a terrorist organization does not mean that all of its parts are, but it does mean that when you target Hezbollah as a whole, you target a terrorist organization. Indiscriminate is a strong word. Now stop making part to whole errors. They are easy enough to see. I\u2019m not making the distinction between civilian elements, you are.

The submarine is a valid target so the chaplain isn't safe, but targeting the chaplain specifically would be against the Geneva Conventions. That's why it's not safe on military bases because bases are valid targets, but they're supposed to be safe off base even in a warzone. Even on an active battlefield, it's illegal to purposefully target medics as they render aid to incapacitated soldiers.\n\nI mean just think about the implications of your argument for a second. Do you think it ought to be allowed under international law to wait for an army medic (or a grunt for that matter) to get off base, follow them to the supermarket, sneak up behind them and shoot them in the head?\n\nWe're not even supposed to drone strike people in warzones unless they're carrying a weapon; experts don't agree whether assassinating Osama Bin Laden was lawful (technically he should have been taken prisoner,) and yet somehow this widespread pager attack blowing people up in the middle of the market and in their homes is legal?\n\nYou might as well start arguing to make it legal to poison food and water rations.",

Especially, in comparison to the raizing of palestine that has gone on in the name of stopping these groups, Israel just proved they did that because they wanted to not because they had to, we aren't then going to give them any leeway on \"impossibly high bars\".",
