It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. \n\nIsrael (I\u2019ll say \u2018allegedly\u2019 for legal reasons, as Israel hasn\u2019t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c\u2019mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I\u2019ve seen. \n\nThese pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. \n\nThe effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah\u2019s communications system, assert Israel\u2019s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. \n\nThe attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. \n\nI know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. \n\nI still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy. \n\nWhat will CMV: proof that the pager attack targeted civilians, suggestions of alternative, more targeted and proportionate methods for Israel to attack its enemies. \n\nWhat will not CMV: anecdotal, unconfirmed tales of mass death as a result of the pager attacks, arguments that focus on Israel\u2019s existence, arguments about Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, or discussions of Israel\u2019s criminal government.

Sure it says they used a bunch of shell companies, but if you traced it to its source what would you find? Even if somebody traced it to its source when you find that kind of source are you supposed to be suspicious of it if you want to try to prevent this? What would \"suspicious behaviour\" have even constituted in this case and would have preventing it not have just resulted in more headache than it was worth because of how indistinguishable it would have been from what might be considered unjustified persecution for which all sorts of organizations exist to supposedly prevent? Just seems to be a violation of trust that somebody would even think about doing this. Are we supposed to just be suspicious of anything which has multiple shell companies which can eventually be traced back to Israel, doesn't that basically give everyone a reason to participate in a boycott, sanction, and divestment if only to stop them from trying to exploit this trust they have as a result of the general good will everyone has towards each other which allows globalized corporate law to even function where you can set up companies where you need them to be and you can have companies owning other companies where appropriate? You can only have a globalized economy if you can be fairly certain that one country isn't going to try to use that to mail bombs to people.",

Even if the pagers had been distributed to one child each and they exploded in their class at school, the death toll in children alone would have been a couple orders of magnitude lower.\n\nYou're right, we have no way of knowing if Hamas officials have a security gap like these pagers.

They didn't just intercept the pagers. They knew that Hezbollah was planning to transition to pagers for security reasons, so they set up a fake company based in Hungary, obtained a contract with a Taiwanese pager brand to manufacture pagers, and started manufacturing and selling pagers (including to regular customers, without explosives!), somehow managed to be contracted to provide Hezbollah with the pagers they wanted, and then made them extra special pagers with explosive PETN, rigged to go off when they received some kind of specially encoded signal.

Armies and military are expected to clearly display uniforms that indicate they\u2019re military and of which country, and it\u2019s very illegal for them to represent themselves as being civilian or a protected group like the Red Cross.\n\nThe issue is that terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah will not follow the rules meant to reduce civilian casualties because they know full well that if they tried to wage war like a legitimate military, Israel would defeat them easily. So they break these rules while still launching missiles at Israel, which forces Israel to retaliate in ways that could conceivably harm civilians. As attacks go, this one was extremely targeted.",

The same way, would people who are criticizing this attack criticize how irresponsible the Hezbollah is and call it a terrorist attack aswell? Or would they be impressed by their restraint at focusing on Israel's communication capabilities and minimize civilian harm, compared to simply launching rockets for instance. Whatever take one has towards this attack, one should at least strive to be consistent with their views. It is ok to criticize Israel's posture and actions in this conflict while recognizing the restraint of the operation. It is also fine to criticize this operation even if you support Israel and condemms Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, for instance. Just be consistent and have the same take towards this you would if it was Israel who suffered this attack for instance.",

Hezbollah in Lebanon also has a number of non-combatant roles in the society that do not overlap with their military wing and would not make for valid targets because it would instead impact Lebanon's ability to govern. Also a reminder that Israel has already indicated that they believe land owned by Lebanon is their right to claim so it stands to reason that Hezbollah would need to actively counterattack just to maintain existing borders.",

International law has a formula for civilian casualties and this attack definitely falls within those ranges, probably by a lot actually. That\u2019s not the only thing the law says though. It requires you to be able to predict what those casualties are beforehand. It\u2019s impossible to do that with this type of attack for the reasons that you mentioned above.",

That\u2019s not even the biggest problem with this suggestion though. You think they were watching the location of hundreds of these things and only detonating them when they were in a location that wouldn\u2019t hurt civilians? GPS wouldn\u2019t tell them who is around them. Or if that person was driving a car. if that person was holding a baby. They also detonated them almost simultaneously which would mean they weren\u2019t monitoring their location in order to detonate them at the right time because then they would have been detonated at different times. This is not a precision attack and because of the lack of a meaningful ability to predict casualties, it\u2019s most likely a war crime. One of those people could have been injured and taken to a hospital. It is a war crime to attack the wounded. Especially in a hospital. So if you can\u2019t predict the number of casualties within a reasonable margin of error especially if it\u2019s possible a a causality could be a war crime because of uncontrollable variables, then the attack itself is likely a war crime because you have to be able to predict that your attack won\u2019t be a war crime.

If I drop an artillery shell on an armored resupply convoy, and that convoy has wounded, it's not a war crime. Just because civilians or invalid military targets (including wounded soldiers) are present does not make something a war crime. \n\nThis was a military communications network used for military purposes by military personnel in an active conflict. It's not a war crime to blow up a radio station on the frontline of Ukraine without knowing whose present or how many civilians are in the building using an anti-radiation missile. This is not meaningfully different. \n\nTo show otherwise you'd have to show that these were pagers broadly used by civilians and not by Hezbollah. But even they have acknowledged they were used almost exclusively by them and carried military messages.\n\nThe two elements at play here are discrimination (this targeted military individuals) and proportionality (the civilian casualties were not excessive relative to the military value of the targets). Your going to have terrible time arguing either was violated unless you can show these pagers where mostly (not just occasionally) used by civilians and that there was a reasonable expectation of massive civilian casualties.",

Like Israel killed many times more kids in the first 40 days then Putin did did in 500+ up until that point, Israel killed more in the first 4 months them killed all conflicts globally the 4 previous years combined. I have seen so much, seen the IDF orchestrate with normal looking citizens to block aid trucks, where the citizens say \u201clet them starve\u201d to anyone with a camera. Seen them shoot animals, bomb goats, drone strike children, just this last week they did two two ton bombs on refugee tents where there is video of palestinians digging up remnants of tents and bodies out of giant craters. I already said the statistics about how indiscriminate they are in the previous comment anyways. Like I *assume* that militants are just the collateral damage *because* Israel never proves they are targeting them, but instead decimates 80% of all residential buildings, schools and healthcare facilities.",

But even then, say by guilt of association everyone who entered Israel on Oct 7 is a terrorist and deserves justice even without a trial, that doesnt include every single person in Palestine who could be considered a militant, not just by age but even by intent. Like if someone never killed a civilian but is fighting drones snd tanks with a rusty ak in their holocoust skeleton city, that person isnt a terrorist.\n\nAnd if the ratio is generally true that Israel kills 7 women or children for every \u201cterrorist\u201d that would mean they are killing 7 women and children for whatever unknown fraction of the 3 remaining men went into Israel on Oct 7, probably a tiny percentage. But that isnt what they really mean they put such a wide envelope on who is a terrorist that I think they consider even wounded children with no surviving family future terrorists, let alone any militant.

That's the strong argument when it comes to targeting.\n\nThe more pertinent IHL is CCW Prot 2, Art. 3, which says that civilians cannot be the target (check) & the harm to civilian population cannot outweigh the military advantage conferred (check).\n\nhttps://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/ccw-amended-protocol-ii-1996/article-3?activeTab=\n\nYou could argue that Art. 5 of this convention, which prevents booby-trapping 'harmless portable objects,' is applicable, but given we are talking about military communications equipment I think that would be an extraordinary stretch.\n\nRather than write everything at length, I encourage review of this write-up, which is sufficiently cautious & nuanced but generally arrives at the conclusion this does not appear to breach IHL: https://lieber.westpoint.edu/exploding-pagers-law/",

Finally, this is not \u201cas precise a weapon as it gets\u201d for those same reasons. You can\u2019t just say oh yea this shipment is going to hezbollah so that\u2019s all we need to know about where they will be and who will be around them.",

Because that's what this argument results in. Claiming Hezbollah is part of the civilian leadership doesn't excuse them, it makes it worse, because now you have connected the ENTIRETY of Lebanon to the crime and not just Hezbollah as an organization. It doesn't matter if it's just 'part' of the government, it's still a government entity committing military hostile action against another country, that's all it needs for a valid case of war of defense... otherwise I could instruct my military to attack another country and just go 'Oops looks my military has gone rogue. Silly me. But it's not us the civilian leadership, so don't you dare counter-attack!' Also 'harmless objects' means civilian objects. What is civilian and what isn't depends entirely on what an item is used for. If a Ford Prius is used by an organization for military purposes than that specific Prius is a military asset and subject to that regulation. It doesn't matter that 99.99% of Ford Priuses are civilian then. Because otherwise I could just equip my military with civilian tools across the board and then claim 'war crimes' if the enemy bombs them. All rules of war utterly DEPEND on clear separation of military and civilian assets, it's probably the single most important rule of the Geneva conventions because pretty much every other rule depends on it. So the moment a force no longer visually separates their military from their civilians the entire Geneva Conventions completely fall apart.",

What the poster you're responding to is pointing out is, due to the nature of the attack, the people detonating had no way to know who else was around when they detonated. Could've been in the middle of field harming no one but the carrier. Could've been in a Hezbollah bunker taking out multiple legitimate targets. Could've been in the middle of a mall or park and killed unrelated innocent children.\n\nThis is quite different from your rocket launcher example because they not only could, but are likely to be carrying the pager in public while on what would appear to be normal business. Any normal civilian sees a guy with a rocket launcher, they're going to get out. A guy with a pager on his belt, assuming its visible at all, would not be cause for alarm. Its hardly cause for a second look.\n\nYou turned this into \"If they stole their equipment among civilians...\" but that's not the discussion. First, if they did store it among civilians and Isreal knew that information, they would not be legally justified in carrying out the attack, because then they knew civilians would get hurt. But where they stored it isn't relevant because expected usage is the question, not storage. The pagers being on Hezbollah personal is expected, but where they are when you choose to detonate is up in the air. And it could very easily have been among a bunch of unrelated civilians. So the attacks meet the legal definition of indescriminate; you can't discriminate if you don't know the circumstances in the first place. You see the distinction?",

Aside from the fact you're comparing a domestic operation (thus subject to US laws and US courts) with a foreign terrorist organization (one that has launched no less than 7,500 rockets, indiscriminately, into Israel since October 7th), and assuming they're somehow comparable, the fact is that this isn't new or even special. I want you to imagine that the Sinaloa cartel was lobbying mortars over the border, and Mexico was telling the US that they were handling it, but never did. Do you think the US would just throw up their hands and say, 'Aw, shucks, nothing we can do'? Or would you guys go in guns blazing? Because US's history speaks volumes about which choice you guys would take.",

When someone rigs a roadside bomb in 2004 Fallujah to make a 'baby crying' noise to draw people close and then blow up, is that not a booby trap? Doesn't matter if it was placed on the road outside of a US Military base and the intended victim was a US soldier, anyone can investigate the noise and often times random innocent people would get hurt in those kind of attacks just like what happened in Lebanon.\n\nThere's a reason Israel isn't taking responsibility for these bombs even though every one knows its them - it's against international law and they want deniability.",

I assure you, international law requires no such thing. No war could ever be waged if combatants were required to guarantee that no civilian would be effected. Civilian to combatant death ratios in war, in general, are much, much higher than people think. It's tragic, but war always results in some civilian casualties, and international law very much acknowledges that fact.",
