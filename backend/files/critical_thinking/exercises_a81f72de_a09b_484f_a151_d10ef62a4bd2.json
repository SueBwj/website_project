        "Statement": "Humans and governments work almost exclusively at their most basic on incentive. Any decision you basically ever make in politics and government, the first thing you need to look at is what incentives does this create and what incentive can I foresee it creating. So what incentive does this create? It creates an incentive that the government wants you to die at 75 years old. It's also a very easy to foresee incentive that your family may want you to die at 75. So you don't spend your money and they get more, they don't have to take care of you, they don't lose their money either. You listed out half the incentive structure already, 'No job, no dignity, no respect, they are angry, kids are gone, you are a burden, you are a bother, you worry'",
