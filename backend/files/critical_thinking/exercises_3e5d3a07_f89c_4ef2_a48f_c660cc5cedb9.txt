        "Statement": "A government policy suggests that individuals should be encouraged to plan their retirement around the age of 75. This policy is presented as a way to ensure better allocation of resources while allowing families to plan for a financially stable future.",

        "Statement": "Humans and governments work almost exclusively at their most basic on incentive. Any decision in politics and government, the first thing to look at is what incentives it creates. This creates an incentive that the government wants you to die at 75 years old. Families may also have incentives for individuals to die at 75 to gain more financially and avoid burdens.",
