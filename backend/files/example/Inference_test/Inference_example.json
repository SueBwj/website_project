        "Statement": "Although it is agreed that China is rapidly modernising its army, there is some doubt surrounding the exact amount it is spending. The research institute 'PIPPI', submits that the annual Chinese defence spending has risen from almost $31 billion in 2000 to over $120 billion in 2010. This figure is almost double the official figure published by the Chinese government, who fail to include many other areas, such as research and development in the official figure each year. In 2010, the United States government spent around $400 billion on military defence. Based on the current level of military growth, statistics suggest that China's defence spending could overtake America's by 2030. In addition to military spending, China's army continues to enjoy the largest number of people within the ranks of its army than any other country.",
