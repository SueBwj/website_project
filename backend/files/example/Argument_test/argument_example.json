        "Explanation": "Accepting the argument as true, avoiding bankruptcy is an essential motive for an organisation, however, the statement does not discuss bankruptcy, rather it is discussing profits and expenses. Protection against bankruptcy is not the topic, and is straying from the point, and is, therefore a weak argument."
