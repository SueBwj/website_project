Humans and governments work almost exclusively at their most basic on *incentive*.\n\nAny decision you basically ever make in politics and government, the first thing you need to look at is what incentives does this create and what incentive can I foresee it creating.\n\nSo what incentive does this create?\n\nIt creates an incentive that the government *wants you to die* at 75 years old.  \n\nIt's also a very easy to foresee incentive that your *family* may want you to die at 75.  So you don't spend your money and they get more, they don't have to take care of you, they don't lose their money either.\n\nYou listed out half the incentive structure already, \"No job, no dignity, no respect, they are angry, kids are gone, you are a burden, you are a bother, you worry\"\n\nSheesh... with that kind of talk... what's the incentive structure you've set up here?\n\nYou've given almost everyone an incentive to *want you to die* and if you don't?  What a burden... how selfish... no respect... why don't you die with dignity? \n\nThis is a terrible idea.
