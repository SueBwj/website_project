    "title": "CMV: Euthanasia should be considered a fundamental right, and specific conditions should govern its implementation. ",
    "description": "The right to choose one's own death, or euthanasia, ought to be recognised as a fundamental human right.\n\nIt is possible to set a time limit for it, like 75 years. Hospitals should be prepared to assist anyone who wishes to dispose of their body after the age of 75. Dying patients should have a designated area in every hospital, and they should receive extra support and care. Their demise ought to be exquisite.\n\nThere ought to be a meditation instructor in every hospital. The terminally ill person should be granted a month of grace and permission to change his mind; he is under no obligation to do so. Suicidal individuals who are emotionally unstable cannot stay that way for a month; their emotional state can fluctuate. Most suicide victims would not have taken their own lives at all if they had waited just one more second. They lose sight of the worth of life because they are enraged, jealous, hateful, or motivated by another emotion.\n\nThe entire issue stems from politicians' belief that legalising euthanasia implies suicide is no longer punishable by law. No, that is not what it means. Suicide remains illegal.\n\nThe medical board must give its approval before euthanasia can occur. A month-long hospital stay, all available support to help the patient become peaceful and quiet, the arrival of friends and family, as well as his wife and kids, are all necessary because he is about to embark on a lengthy journey. He is beyond all possibility of being stopped; he has lived a long life and feels that his work is done.\n\nIn addition, he ought to learn how to meditate during this one-month period so that he can practise it until his death. Additionally, medical assistance for death ought to be provided in a manner similar to that of a deep sleep—that is, gradually, concurrently with meditation. We have the power to transform the enlightenment of thousands of deaths.\n\nAdditionally, there is no fear of suicide because he will not attempt suicide; even if he did, it would still be illegal. He's requesting authorisation. With the medical board's approval... and he has a month to make up his mind, any time during that month.\n\n\"I don't want to die\" is something he can say on his last day and then return home. Since it is his decision, there is no issue.\n\nMany countries are currently experiencing extremely peculiar circumstances. Individuals attempt suicide; if they are successful, great; if not, the court sentences them to death. It's odd that they were acting in that way. They found themselves in the midst. The trial will now last for two years, during which time the man will have to be hanged once more after judges and advocates argue and this and that. In the first place, he was working alone on that! What's the point of all this nonsense?\n\nAdditionally, as medical science advances and people live longer, euthanasia is becoming more and more necessary. There isn't a single skeleton from a person who lived more than forty years ago that has been discovered by scientists from 5,000 years ago. Life was extremely valuable five thousand years ago, when the average lifespan was forty years old and nine out of ten newborns would perish within two years. Only one would survive.\n\nHippocrates also bestowed upon the medical community the duty to preserve life in all circumstances. Since he was not a seer, he was unaware. He lacked the wisdom to realise that one day all ten children would survive. That is currently taking place. Nine more children are living, but medical science also makes it possible for people to live longer—living to be 90 or even 100 years old is not uncommon. It is quite simple to locate someone who is 100 years old or 90 years old in developed nations.\n\nThousands of patients in American hospitals are just resting on their beds while being connected to a variety of devices. Many people use artificial respiration devices. If the person is unable to breathe, what good is it? How do you think he will respond? And when there are so many starving and dying on the streets, why are you burdening the entire country with this person?\n\nThirty million Americans live on the streets without access to clothing, food, or shelter. Thousands more occupy hospital beds, using the services of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals as well as their labour and medications.\n\nAlthough everyone is aware that they will pass away eventually, you should try to prolong their life.\n\nTheir desire is to pass away. They yell that the doctor is powerless to stop them from dying. These people are being forced to live, which is obviously against democratic principles. They should have some rights.\n\nThat's why I want it to be extremely logical. After 75 or 80 years, life has been sufficiently experienced. The kids are grown up; when you reach eighty, your kids will be fifty or fifty-five years old; they are ageing. You don't need to worry or be bothered right now. You are a burden now that you are retired, and you are unsure of what to do.\n\nAnd for good reason—they have no job, no dignity, and no respect—which is why elderly people are always annoyed. Nobody is concerned about them or pays attention to them. They're prepared to yell, get angry, and fight. They are merely expressing their frustrations; their true desire is to pass away. They can't even express it, though. The concept of death itself is nonreligious and unchristian.\n\nThey ought to be allowed the freedom to not just die, but also to be trained in death techniques for a month. Physical care and meditation should be fundamental components of that training. They ought to pass away soundly, completely, quietly, and peacefully, slowly sinking into a deep sleep.\n\nAdditionally, if meditation and sleep are combined, they might pass away enlightened. They might be aware that they are a part of eternity and that only the body remains.\n\nTheir death will be preferable to an ordinary death since the latter denies you the opportunity to achieve enlightenment. Indeed, an increasing number of people will choose to pass away in hospitals or other specialised death facilities where all the necessary arrangements have been made. You can pass away from this life with immense gratitude and in a joyful, exuberant manner.\n\nI support euthanasia, but only under these circumstances.\n",

They're prepared to yell, get angry, and fight. They are merely expressing their frustrations; their true desire is to pass away\n\nThis is a huge ball of unsupported assumptions. [40% of people over 65 have as their medical directive to provide any and all lifesaveing care.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db54.htm#:~:text=Those%20aged%2065%20and%20over,(Figures%204%20and%205).) So, at least 40% of people **do not** have a desire to pass away. \n\nMy 94 year old grandmother is *super* stoked that she's still alive this summer, because we have tickets to go see Deadpool together opening night. She doesn't need a job, she raised 8 kids and cared for her ailing husband for the past 30 years. She is super dignified; never leaves the house without looking like an elderly model. Her old university regularly calls her to guest lecture, so she is respected. I, at least, am concerned with her and pay attention, I'm taking her to Deadpool (on her suggestion by the way). She is not prepared to yell get angry or fight. She's a sweet old lady. \n\nThe only thing she is frustrated with is that she won't live another 20 years.",
        "Your view is self contradictory. How can something be claimed to both be a human right and need to be strictly regulated? If it is a right there should be no restrictions at all. If it needs restrictions and the actions of others then it is not a right. \n\n\nWhat country are you from where people who attempt suicide are killed?

        ">The right to choose one's own death, or euthanasia\n\nIs that your definition of euthanasia?

        ">The entire issue stems from politicians' belief that legalising euthanasia implies suicide is no longer punishable by law.\n\nThis is pretty obviously not true, because in the United States Suicide is legal but assisted suicide is not.",
        "I’m guessing you’re talking with a specific country in mind? It is legal where I am from.",
        "What does “fundamental right” mean here? If it means the ability to choose to take your own life, well guess what you’re free to choose from a variety of highly succesful options and follow through, no one is stopping you. If it means the ability to obtain PAS, then what happens if you can’t get a doctor that wants to give it to you? Is the government going to force in some way third parties to help you kill yourself, because if so that’s a messy business to make people take part in killing someone, no matter how cleansed or small their role is. Right to do something and right I have something aren’t the same thing, and I’m not sure how PAS can be a right without potentially forcing someone else into the process.",
        "I agree with a lot of what you said, but it seems like there's an entire class of counter-arguments you don't seem to have considered—namely, the potential for abuse. \n\nSome examples of potential abuse include:\n\n- Family members pressuring the patient into euthanasia, out of view from the doctor, and for any number of reasons (desire for inheritance, desire to reduce expenditure, grudges, etc). Look at the number of existing inheritance squabbles. Euthanasia will only be a weapon here. \n\n- Bad actors, (e.g. young women targeting sick old men) aiming to take a person's inheritance after euthanasia. Again, look at the existing number of inheritance scams. Euthanasia worsens this. \n\n- Incentives for corrupt officials to push euthanasia cases through under the table, even if the criteria is not entirely fulfilled (e.g. cases where patient has large inheritance and no heirs -> inheritance goes to the state, or when patient has valuable organs which can be donated, etc)\n\n- Vulnerability to \"laundered\" murders, e.g. criminals establish ties to a hospital, and use legitimate euthanasia cases to mask illicit murders, making murder logistics easier (e.g. disposal of dead bodies etc)\n\n- Privatized healthcare will make this a disaster. A person wanting to die has less incentive to care what happens to their money. A privatized hospital system might exploit this and charge through the nose for euthanasia, exploiting the limited options of a patient, who is by definition under duress, since they're seeking euthanasia due to some kind of irreconcilable distress.\n\nIn essence, the key problem is that legal euthanasia creates a conflict of interest. With legal euthanasia, while it does help improve the quality of life for a small subset of the population, it increases the likelihood that the population in general might be taken advantage of. While this is not a cut-and-dry case for \"euthanasia is always 100% bad\", it does make the situation considerably more complex, and in my opinion, leans towards the side of \"ban euthanasia to be on the safe side\", particularly in countries with largely privatized healthcare or widespread corruption.",
        "Mate you got to research this more\n\nLike genuinely I agree with your title statement.  I think euthanasia should be an option.  I come from a country where it is an option in specific circumstance (Australia) and I have an elderly relative who is contemplating it (she has a LOT of health problems).\n\nBut I start reading your body text and run into:\n\n>The entire issue stems from politicians' belief that legalising euthanasia implies suicide is no longer punishable by law. No, that is not what it means. Suicide remains illegal.\n\nWhere are you in the world where suicide is illegal? Like have a gander [at the map on this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation). Suicide is legal in most of the world. Hell from that page you could navigate [to the page for assisted suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_dying_in_Australia) and you might compare what you are explaining to how its carried out in the parts of the world where it occurs. There is legislation and data and procedures out there you could investigate if you choose actual real world experience over \"insight\".\n\n>Many countries are currently experiencing extremely peculiar circumstances. Individuals attempt suicide; if they are successful, great; if not, the court sentences them to death. \n\nAgain, which countries are these? Go back to that map I linked earlier.  OR check out[ this page](https://www.understandsuicide.com/_files/ugd/2caebd_62c53227c2784fd5ae5d3833321e7d62.pdf?index=true) which lists what punishments are given for suicide.  Which ones say its the death penalty? Because I see a bunch of misdemeanors and imprisonments (not that those aren't bad, but they are certainly better than death).\n\nI'm stopping here but this goes back to pretty much every discussion we've had. Are you willing to acknowledge the inaccuracies in your first few paragraphs?",
        "I’m not sure “old people are alone and isolated, and a bit of a burden, so maybe they should kill themselves” is the kind option.\n\nYou might want to try going to an old-folks home to chat and play scrabble or something like that if you want to do something helpful.",
        "One thing to consider is that the complete normalization of euthanasia would inevitably create cases where it appears to be chosen \"freely\", but is actually done under pressure.\n\nCases like very old people in crowded nursing homes who would be encouraged to do it, or even old parents who no longer have a good relationship with their children and their children are currently taking care of them",
        "I am not saying I disagree. However, your argument for euthanasia has several logical fallacies. \n\nFirstly, it presents a false dichotomy by setting up a binary choice between euthanasia and enduring a life of suffering and indignity in old age, without considering other alternatives such as improved palliative care, social support, or mental health interventions. \n\nSecondly, it employs a slippery slope fallacy by suggesting that without euthanasia, people will inevitably suffer needlessly and that legalising euthanasia will lead to widespread, enlightened deaths. This oversimplifies the complexities and nuances of end-of-life care and the ethical considerations involved.\n\nThe argument frequently relies on an appeal to emotion, using emotionally charged language to persuade the reader, such as describing elderly individuals as burdens or emphasizing their suffering and lack of dignity. This approach can overshadow rational discussion and critical analysis. \n\nAdditionally, the text makes a hasty generalization by assuming that all elderly people or terminally ill patients desire euthanasia and that their quality of life is uniformly poor. It generalizes from specific cases to all individuals in these situations without sufficient evidence.\n\nIt also begs the question by assuming that euthanasia is a fundamental human right without providing a solid ethical foundation or evidence to support this claim, thus taking the conclusion for granted in the premises. While I personally agree with this, you need to back it with reasons if you really want us to change our view. \n\nThe argument references historical lifespans and Hippocrates to imply that contemporary views on euthanasia should be adopted because of changes in life expectancy and medical advancements, without critically examining the ethical principles involved. This appeal to tradition is another logical fallacy.\n\nAdditionally, the discussion about people living on the streets and the inefficiency of hospital resources serves as a red herring, diverting attention from the core ethical and legal issues surrounding euthanasia.\n\nLastly, the text employs a false analogy by comparing the natural death of elderly individuals with the deliberate act of euthanasia, equating passive death due to age or illness with active intervention to end life.\n\nI personally support euthanasia, but I think the argument could be made better.",

It also ignores that such a policy would be prohibitively expensive, whether on an individual or the public purse.  \n\nIt strips a person of the basic dignity of being able to live  one's final days in familiar surroundings and then having the choice to die on one's terms.  A person could also be in pain to the extent no exquisite experience is possible.\n\nI do think a requirement of a terminal illness or a chronic illness where a decent quality of life cannot be achieved should be required, but the age should be irrelevant.

And if they are not, they would be living in their homes.\n\nSo why would a government be willing to pay for a third type of institution and what are their real purpose?\n\nWhen we look at history, similar government institutions were indeed formed in past. They were funded entirely by government and they promised *better morals*, *education* and *enlightment*, many still persist today.\n\nThose institutions were called *persuasion rooms*. and they were a critical component of authoritian governments that are ruled by facism. \n\nUnlike camps who simply tortured dissidents, they are strictly formed with *good intentions*, *good morality* that use psychological pressure & severe brainwashing rather than physical force to achieve desired behaviour.\n\nWhile you are allowed to leave on paper, in reality they put enough barriers that it was not simply feasable to leave for most people.\n\nIn this case, that premise about “death in dignity” would be the central morality to push people into early deaths. If they dont apply enough pressure, they wont deliver results and thus not useful enough for government to pay for the cost.\n\nDeath is death, while a painless death is preferable, there is no inherent dignity in death unless… you decide to end it early *like a dignified citizen with a proper servitude to their family that will get their inheritance early and a proper obedience to the government who only thinks for the best for all*.",

People don't fit into neat categories, and emotional states can change. How can you ensure decisions made under emotional distress aren't irreversible mistakes?

You are a burden now that you are retired, and you are unsure of what to do.\n\nThis is you generalizing the experience of the elderly, and unfairly so. **Most** elderly people are not described by this. It is an erroneous generalization. \n\n>The proposal aims to provide a compassionate option for those who might be struggling, offering a dignified process with psychological support and a thoughtful decision-making period\n\nWe have that; it is called [Hospice Care](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/hospice-and-palliative-care/what-are-palliative-care-and-hospice-care)",
        ">Here are specific dates for when some countries formally removed laws criminalizing suicide:\n\n>**United Kingdom**: Suicide was decriminalized on September 1, 1961, with the enactment of the Suicide Act 1961.\n\n>**France**: Suicide was effectively decriminalized with the Napoleonic Code reforms in 1810 and subsequent changes throughout the 19th century.\n\n>**Germany**: Formal decriminalization occurred gradually, with significant changes occurring by the early 20th century, particularly after the Weimar Republic era (1919–1933).\n\n>**United States**: Decriminalization varied by state, with most states moving to decriminalize suicide in the latter half of the 20th century, particularly by the 1970s.\n\n>**India**: As of now, Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalizes attempted suicide, has not been formally removed, though there have been discussions and proposals for reform.\n\nYour post is written in the present tense so I was assuming we were discussing this with respect to the laws that exist in this year (2024).  Please let me know if you wanted this to be a discussion framed around the early 1900s. From That:\n\n*Do you accept that suicide in this current year is largely legal worldwide?*\n\n>**England**: The death penalty for suicide attempts was abolished with the Suicide Act of 1961.\n\n>**France**: The practice was effectively abolished with the French Penal Code reform of 1791, which reduced the severity of penalties for suicide attempts.\n\n>**Scotland**: The death penalty for suicide attempts was abolished with the 1823 statute, which began to move away from criminalizing suicide.\n\n>**Switzerland**: By the early 19th century, legal reforms had moved away from capital punishment for suicide attempts, with specific reforms occurring in the early 1800s.\n\n>**Italy**: The death penalty for suicide attempts was abolished with the introduction of the Italian Penal Code in 1889, which decriminalized suicide attempts.\n\n>**Spain**: The Spanish Penal Code of 1870 began to move away from punishing suicide attempts, though reforms continued through the early 20th century.\n\nWhere did you get this information? I went looking for some discussion of some of these.  The easiest to find was the details regarding England, since that's the only one that happened in the last hundred years. I found [this article](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14374296) discussing the punishments laid down:\n\n>A Times leader on the subject noted that in 1956, 5,387 failed suicide attempts were known to police, and of those 613 were prosecuted. Most were discharged, fined or put on probation, but 33 were sent to prison.\n\nas we go back in time it gets more and more difficult to find, so if you could provide your source that would be great. \n\nBut even so, \n\n*Do you have any evidence that people are being executed for suicide attempts in 2024?*",

They leave nothing, maybe no businesses, no money, no house, no property.\n\nYou are *vastly* underestimating the incentive and the *pressure* people will not only be put under to die, but the pressure they will put on themselves, because the incentive you've created is that they *should die*.\n\nThe power to choose or not means nothing when the incentive structure is entirely against them.\n\nWe all have tons of things we have a choice to do, and we do not do them and it's entirely because of incentive.",
        "> I think its safe to generalize this.\n\nBased on what? This just seems like blatant agism to me. Right now the Baby Boomer generation is the age you describe.

        "But 75 year's old child will all be around 50 years old. They are also not so far away from becoming 75 years old. Those 50 years old children will understand that if they pressure thier parents to die, thier child will also do the same for them. So this will motivate not to pressure thier parents to die at 75",

        "Yes... that's how incentive works...\n\nEvery generation presses the last one, and every generation will learn that is what they are *supposed to do*...\n\nWhy do you think men think they are *supposed* to be the higher payed person in a home?

        "I think you misunderstood what i was sayiny\n\nI was saying that those children who are around 50 years old will be motivated not to pressure thier parents to die at 75 because other wise thier child will also pressure them to die at 75.",
        "Still safe, because most of them are unemployed. 78 percent",
        "I think you are giving people far too much credit for being able to think long term. Most people don't recognize that the way they treat their spouse is the way their children will be expected to be treated by their spouse.",
        "You misunderstood what I said.\n\nI know exactly what you are saying, but it's a fantasy.\n\nI gave you examples of why it's a fantasy and how incentive drives *everything in the entire world*.\n\nYou are simply not understanding how innate incentive is to everything that humans do.

        "So? They are not \"unemployed\". They are retired. There is a huge difference. Unemployed means you don't have a job and are looking for work. Retired means you worked for 40+ years and now are fucking taking it easy.\n\nDo you think people live to work, and that once they cannot work they lose the will to live?",
        "Yes situation is similar to the example you are giving but its different. Its not about their children, its about them in this situation. And they would like to prevent it. Nobody would like to know when they are going to die.

        "I don't see the relevance of your example. Because this situation is quite different from others. Because here you are getting opportunity to make your own death date, and its not so far, just 20 to 25 years away. And no body wants to know when they are going to die. And they know perfectly well that if the pressure their parents to die, they will have to do so. Their child own child will then pressure them.

        "Thanks for clarifying that definition. \n\n>Do you think people live to work, and that once they cannot work they lose the will to live?\n\nOf course not. Many would not. But there will always be some, for those they should be allowed after 75. Also 95 percent of people who are above 65 years old suffer from all kinds of illness. Many would choose to end their life instead of suffering unnecessarily.",
